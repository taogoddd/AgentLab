Based on the provided user intent, the caption of bot's final observation and its response, did the bot successfully execute the task? Please reason step by step.

Note:
- The trajectory descriptions are essentially noisy captions of the screenshots captured during bot's execution. And you should infer what actions the bot took yourself.
- You should categorize the execution into one of the three status:
    - task-possible-bot-success: The bot successfully executed the task.
    - task-possible-bot-fail: The bot failed to execute the task.
    - task-impossible: The task is impossible to execute in nature given the user intent and the environment. For example, if the user wants to buy a product that does not exist in the environment. You should carefully distinguish this from bot-fail.

Format your response as a valid json:
{{
    "thoughts": "{{Your thoughts here, discuss if and how the trajectory progress towards the task and then reason about the final status. You should provide an explicit reason when determining the final status.}}",

Given the user's intent, the agent's action history, the final state of the webpage, and the agent's response to the user, your goal is to decide whether the agent's execution is successful or not.

There are three types of tasks:
1. Information seeking: The user wants to obtain certain information from the webpage, such as the information of a product, reviews, map info, comparison of map routes, etc. The bot's response must contain the information the user wants, or explicitly state that the information is not available. Otherwise, e.g. the bot encounters an exception and respond with the error content, the task is considered a failure. Besides, be careful about the sufficiency of the agent's actions. For example, when asked to list the top-searched items in a shop, the agent should order the items by the number of searches, and then return the top items. If the ordering action is missing, the task is likely to fail.
2. Site navigation: The user wants to navigate to a specific page. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.
3. Content modification: The user wants to modify the content of a webpage or configuration. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.
