# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The previous action to click on the "Catalog" link successfully removed the overlay. Now, I will proceed to add a new product by clicking the "Add Product" button again.
</think>

<action>
click('718')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The current page is the "New Product" page in the Magento Admin Panel. To add a new product, I need to fill in the required fields. The required fields are "Product Name," "SKU," and "Price." I will start by filling in the "Product Name" field.
</think>

<action>
fill('933', 'New Product Name')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The "Product Name" field has been successfully filled with "New Product Name." The next required field to fill is the "SKU" field. I will proceed to fill in the "SKU" field.
</think>

<action>
fill('939', 'NEW-PRODUCT-SKU')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The "SKU" field has been successfully filled with "NEW-PRODUCT-SKU." The next required field to fill is the "Price" field. I will proceed to fill in the "Price" field.
</think>

<action>
fill('950', '100')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The "Price" field has been successfully filled with "100." Now that all the required fields ("Product Name," "SKU," and "Price") have been filled, the next step is to save the new product. I will proceed by clicking the "Save" button.
</think>

<action>
click('841')
</action>

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


6 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).
    Examples:
        noop()

        noop(500)

fill(bid: str, value: str)
    Description: Fill out a form field. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.
    Examples:
        fill('237', 'example value')

        fill('45', 'multi-line\nexample')

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.
    Examples:
        select_option('a48', 'blue')

        select_option('c48', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])

click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
    Description: Click an element.
    Examples:
        click('a51')

        click('b22', button='right')

        click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])

clear(bid: str)
    Description: Clear the input field.
    Examples:
        clear('996')

send_msg_to_user(text: str)

Only a single action can be provided at once. Example:
fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')


# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>

[ASSISTANT]
<think>
The product has been successfully saved, as indicated by the message "You saved the product." The next logical step is to navigate back to the product catalog to verify the new product's addition. I will click the "Back" button to return to the product catalog.
</think>

<action>
click('691')
</action>
