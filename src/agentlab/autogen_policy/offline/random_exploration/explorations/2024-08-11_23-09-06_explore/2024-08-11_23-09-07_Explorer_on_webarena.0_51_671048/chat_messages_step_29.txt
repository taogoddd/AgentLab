# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The search has successfully located the new product "New Product Name" in the product list. To verify the details and ensure the product has been added correctly, I will click on the "Edit" link associated with this product.
</think>

<action>
click('1814')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The product details page for "New Product Name" is displayed. To ensure the product is correctly added, I will save the product details. This will confirm that all the necessary information is correctly entered and saved in the system.
</think>

<action>
click('865')
</action>

## step 2

However, the product list is already visible, and the new product "New Product Name" is present in the list. To ensure the product is correctly added, I will verify its details directly from the product list. I will click on the "Edit" link associated with the new product to review its details.
