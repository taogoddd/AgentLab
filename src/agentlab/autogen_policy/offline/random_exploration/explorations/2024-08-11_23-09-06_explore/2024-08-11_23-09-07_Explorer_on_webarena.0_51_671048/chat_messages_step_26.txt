# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The product list is visible, and I need to verify the presence of the new product "New Product Name." I will scroll through the product list to locate the new product and ensure it has been added correctly.
</think>

<action>
noop(1000)
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The product list is visible, and I need to verify the presence of the new product "New Product Name." I will scroll through the product list to locate the new product and ensure it has been added correctly. Since the product list is long, I will use the search functionality to quickly locate the new product.
</think>

<action>
fill('1385', 'New Product Name')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The search field has been filled with "New Product Name." The next step is to execute the search to locate the new product in the list. I will click the "Search" button to perform the search.
</think>

<action>
click('1386')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The search has successfully located the new product "New Product Name" in the product list. To verify the details and ensure the product has been added correctly, I will click on the "Edit" link associated with this product.
</think>

<action>
click('1814')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The product details page for "New Product Name" is displayed. To ensure the product is correctly added, I will save the product details. This will confirm that all the necessary information is correctly entered and saved in the system.
</think>

<action>
click('865')
</action>

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.

    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).
    Examples:

    Description: Fill out a form field. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.

    Description: Click an element.

each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.

From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>
