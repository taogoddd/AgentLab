# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The previous action of clicking the "Delete" button did not remove the post, and the page still displays the post along with options to edit, delete, upvote, downvote, and comment on the post.

dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>
