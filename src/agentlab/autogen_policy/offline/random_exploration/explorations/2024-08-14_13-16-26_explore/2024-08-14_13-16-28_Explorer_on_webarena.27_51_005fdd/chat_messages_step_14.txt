## Focused element:
bid='121'


# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The previous action of clicking the "Submit" link has navigated to the "Create submission" page. The page now displays a form to create a new submission with fields for URL, Title, and Body, as well as options to select the type of submission (URL or Image) and the forum (AskReddit).

To explore more functionalities, I can interact with elements such as the radio buttons to switch between URL and Image submission types, the textboxes to enter the URL, Title, and Body, or the "Create submission" button to submit the form.

I will start by filling in the "Title" textbox with a sample title.
</think>

<action>
fill('138', 'Sample Title')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The previous action of filling in the "Title" textbox with "Sample Title" has successfully populated the textbox with the sample title. The page now displays the filled "Title" textbox along with the "Body" textbox and other submission options.

To proceed, I will fill in the "Body" textbox with a sample body text to complete the submission form.
</think>

<action>
fill('143', 'This is a sample body text.')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The previous action of filling in the "Body" textbox with "This is a sample body text." has successfully populated the textbox with the sample body text. The page now displays the filled "Body" textbox along with the "Title" textbox and other submission options.

To proceed, I will click the "Create submission" button to submit the form and create the new post.
</think>

<action>
click('396')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The previous action of clicking the "Create submission" button has successfully created a new post with the title "Sample Title" and the body text "This is a sample body text." The page now displays the newly created post along with options to edit, delete, upvote, downvote, and comment on the post.

To explore more functionalities, I can interact with elements such as the "Edit" link to modify the post, the "Delete" button to remove the post, the upvote and downvote buttons to change the post's vote count, or the comment section to add a new comment.

I will click on the "Edit" link to see if it allows me to modify the post.
</think>

<action>
click('148')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The previous action of clicking the "Edit" link has navigated to the "Editing submission" page. The page now displays a form to edit the existing submission with fields for URL, Title, and Body, as well as a preview section.

To explore more functionalities, I can interact with elements such as the textboxes to modify the URL, Title, and Body, or the "Edit submission" button to save the changes.

I will start by modifying the "Title" textbox with a new title.
</think>

<action>
fill('121', 'Updated Sample Title')
</action>

# Action space:

    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.

dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

</action>
