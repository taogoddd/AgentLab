## Focused element:
bid='116'


# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The "AskReddit" forum has been successfully selected from the dropdown menu. The next step in the submission creation process is to click the "Create submission" button to finalize and submit the post. This will help in exploring the submission creation process further.
</think>

<action>
click('399')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The "Create submission" button was clicked, but the submission was not successful due to a message indicating that I cannot post more and need to wait a while before trying again. This suggests that there might be a rate limit or posting restriction in place. To explore further, I will navigate to the "Home" page to see if there are any additional options or information available there.
</think>

<action>
click('30')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The "Home" page has been successfully loaded, displaying various submissions. To explore further, I will click on the "Forums" link to see what forums are available and what options they provide.
</think>

<action>
click('43')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The current page displays a list of forums with options to subscribe or unsubscribe to each forum. There is also a "Create forum" button available. To explore the functionality of creating a new forum, I will click on the "Create forum" button.
</think>

<action>
click('139')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The "Create new forum" page has loaded, displaying fields for "Name," "Title," "Description," "Sidebar," and "Tags." To proceed with creating a new forum, I will start by filling out the "Name" field. This field is required, so I will enter a sample name for the forum.
</think>

<action>
fill('116', 'SampleForumName')
</action>

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>
