# Instructions
Your objective is to discover diverse and interesting tasks (that a human might give to an agent) by interacting
with the webpage through these actions. Youâ€™ve executed the following actions, and observed the following webpage
states 
# Observation of current step:

## URL of the page:
http://localhost:9999/wiki/_diff?to=a106a609-87f5-4455-aa90-c27758b4f28c
Note: This is the subpage '/wiki/_diff?to=a106a609-87f5-4455-aa90-c27758b4f28c' of reddit website.

## AXTree:
Note: [bid] is the unique alpha-numeric identifier at the beginning of lines for each element in the AXTree. Always use bid to refer to elements in your actions.

Note: You can only interact with visible elements. If the "visible" tag is not
present, the element is not visible on the page.

RootWebArea '500 Internal Server Error', focused
	[6] banner '', visible
		[7] paragraph '', visible
			[8] image '', visible
		[9] heading '500 Internal Server Error', visible
	[10] navigation '', visible
		[11] paragraph '', visible
			[12] link 'Go to home page', clickable, visible

## Focused element:
bid='5'


# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The "Title" field has been successfully filled with "Sample Wiki Page Title". The next step is to fill in the "Body" field to complete the form for creating the wiki page. I will proceed by filling in the "Body" field with some sample content.
</think>

<action>
fill('127', 'This is a sample body content for the wiki page.')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The "Body" field has been successfully filled with the sample content. The next step is to save the wiki page. I will proceed by clicking the "Save" button to submit the form and create the wiki page.
</think>

<action>
click('260')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The wiki page titled "Sample Wiki Page Title" has been successfully created with the provided content. Now, I will explore other elements on the page to identify additional tasks or actions that can be performed. I will start by clicking the "Edit page" link to see if there are any interesting tasks related to editing the wiki page.
</think>

<action>
click('123')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The current page is the editing interface for the wiki page titled "index". The "Title" and "Body" fields are already filled with sample content. To explore additional tasks, I will click on the "Page history" link to see if there are any interesting actions related to the history of the wiki page.
</think>

<action>
click('271')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The current page displays the history of the wiki page titled "index". It shows a table with columns for "Compare", "ID", "Revised", and "User". There is a "Compare" button available, which likely allows comparing different revisions of the page. To explore this functionality, I will select the radio button next to the available revision and then click the "Compare" button.
</think>

<action>
click('135')
</action>

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
