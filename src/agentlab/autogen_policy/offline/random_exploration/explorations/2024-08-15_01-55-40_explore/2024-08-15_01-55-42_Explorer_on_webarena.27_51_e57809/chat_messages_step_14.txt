## Focused element:
bid='17'


# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The previous action to click the "Submit" link successfully navigated back to the submission page. The form for creating a submission is displayed, with fields for "Title", "Body", and "Forum". Since the previous attempt to submit a post was blocked due to a posting limit, I will explore other elements on the page to identify additional tasks or actions that can be performed. I will start by clicking the "Wiki" link to see if there are any interesting tasks related to the wiki.
</think>

<action>
click('42')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The current page indicates that the requested wiki page was not found. There is an option to create this page. To explore the possibility of creating a new wiki page, I will click on the "Create this page" link.
</think>

<action>
click('111')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The current page is for creating a new wiki page titled "index". The form requires a "Title" and "Body" to be filled out. The "URL" field is already populated and disabled. To proceed with creating the wiki page, I will fill in the "Title" field first.
</think>

<action>
fill('121', 'Sample Wiki Page Title')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The "Title" field has been successfully filled with "Sample Wiki Page Title". The next step is to fill in the "Body" field to complete the form for creating the wiki page. I will proceed by filling in the "Body" field with some sample content.
</think>

<action>
fill('127', 'This is a sample body content for the wiki page.')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The "Body" field has been successfully filled with the sample content. The next step is to save the wiki page. I will proceed by clicking the "Save" button to submit the form and create the wiki page.
</think>

<action>
click('260')
</action>
