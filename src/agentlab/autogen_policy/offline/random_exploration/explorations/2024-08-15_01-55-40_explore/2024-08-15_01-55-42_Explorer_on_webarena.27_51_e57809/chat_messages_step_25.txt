# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>

[ASSISTANT]
<think>
The "Create submission" button was clicked, but the submission was not successful due to a message indicating that I cannot post more and need to wait a while before trying again. This suggests that there might be a rate limit or posting restriction in place. To explore further, I will navigate to the "Home" page to see if there are any additional options or information available there.
</think>

<action>
click('30')
</action>
