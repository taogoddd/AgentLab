## Focused element:
bid='174'


# History of last 5 interaction with the task:

## step 0

<think>
The previous action to click on the "Back" button was successful, and I am now back on the invoices page. To proceed with viewing the details of the invoice for order #000000299, I will click on the "View" link in the "Action" column for the corresponding invoice.
</think>

<action>
click('1182')
</action>

## step 1

<think>
The previous action to click on the "View" link was successful, and I am now viewing the details of invoice #000000003 for order #000000299. The page includes order and account information, address information, payment and shipping methods, items invoiced, and order totals. To proceed, I will click on the "Print" button to print the invoice details.
</think>

<action>
click('689')
</action>

## step 2

<think>
The previous action to click on the "Print" button did not succeed. The page still displays the details of invoice #000000003 for order #000000299. To proceed, I will click on the "Edit Customer" link to view and possibly edit the customer details.
</think>

<action>
click('725')
</action>

## step 3

<think>
The previous action to click on the "Edit Customer" link was successful, and I am now on the customer edit page for Sarah Miller. To proceed, I will save any changes made to the customer details by clicking on the "Save Customer" button.
</think>

<action>
click('755')
</action>

## step 4

<think>
The previous action to save the customer was successful, as indicated by the message "You saved the customer." The current page shows the customer list, but no records are found. To proceed, I will add a new customer by clicking on the "Add New Customer" button.
</think>

<action>
click('714')
</action>

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


6 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).
    Examples:
        noop()

        noop(500)

send_msg_to_user(text: str)
    Description: Sends a message to the user.
    Examples:
        send_msg_to_user('Based on the results of my search, the city was built in 1751.')

fill(bid: str, value: str)
    Description: Fill out a form field. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.
    Examples:
        fill('237', 'example value')

        fill('45', 'multi-line\nexample')

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.
    Examples:
        select_option('a48', 'blue')

        select_option('c48', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])

click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
    Description: Click an element.
    Examples:
        click('a51')

        click('b22', button='right')

        click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])

clear(bid: str)
    Description: Clear the input field.
    Examples:
        clear('996')

0 augmented actions are available. These actions are more task-specific and may help you achieve your goal faster.
Only a single action can be provided at once. Example:
fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')


# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>

[ASSISTANT]
<think>
The previous action to click on the "Add New Customer" button was successful, and I am now on the "New Customer" page. To proceed with adding a new customer, I will start by filling in the "First Name" field.
</think>

<action>
fill('808', 'John')
</action>
