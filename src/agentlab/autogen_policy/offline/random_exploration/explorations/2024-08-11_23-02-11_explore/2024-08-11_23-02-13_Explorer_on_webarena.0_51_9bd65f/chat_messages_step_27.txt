# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them

elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


6 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).
    Examples:
        noop()

        noop(500)

    Description: Sends a message to the user.
    Examples:

fill(bid: str, value: str)
    Description: Fill out a form field. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.
    Examples:
        fill('237', 'example value')

        fill('45', 'multi-line\nexample')

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>

[ASSISTANT]
<think>
The previous action to save the new customer information was successful, as indicated by the message "You saved the customer." The next step is to verify that the new customer has been added to the customer list. I will proceed by searching for the new customer using the search functionality.
</think>

<action>
fill('849', 'John Doe')
</action>
