# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them

elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


6 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).
    Examples:

    Description: Sends a message to the user.

    Examples:
        fill('237', 'example value')

        fill('45', 'multi-line\nexample')

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.

click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
    Description: Click an element.
    Examples:
        click('a51')

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>

[ASSISTANT]
<think>
The previous action to click on the "Back" button was successful, and I am now back on the invoices page. To proceed with viewing the details of the invoice for order #000000299, I will click on the "View" link in the "Action" column for the corresponding invoice.
