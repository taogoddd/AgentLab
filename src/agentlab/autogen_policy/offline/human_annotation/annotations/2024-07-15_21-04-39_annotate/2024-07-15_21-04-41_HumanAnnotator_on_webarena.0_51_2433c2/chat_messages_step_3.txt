# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them
are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to
elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


7 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).
    Examples:
        noop()

        noop(500)

fill(bid: str, value: str)
    Description: Fill out a form field. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for <input>, <textarea> and [contenteditable] elements.
    Examples:
        fill('237', 'example value')

        fill('45', 'multi-line\nexample')

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])
    Description: Select one or multiple options in a <select> element. You can specify option value or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.
    Examples:
        select_option('a48', 'blue')

        select_option('c48', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])

click(bid: str, button: Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] = 'left', modifiers: list[typing.Literal['Alt', 'Control', 'Meta', 'Shift']] = [])
    Description: Click an element.
    Examples:
        click('a51')

        click('b22', button='right')

        click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])

    Examples:
        clear('996')

send_msg_to_user(text: str)
    Description: Sends a message to the user.
    Examples:
        send_msg_to_user('Based on the results of my search, the city was built in 1751.')

1 augmented actions are available. These actions are more task-specific and may help you achieve your goal faster.
go_to_forum(forum_name: str)
    Description: [AUGMENTED] Navigate to the forum page with the given forum name.
    Examples:
        go_to_forum('')

# Plan:

You just executed step -1 of the previously proposed plan:
No plan yet

After reviewing the effect of your previous actions, verify if your plan is still
relevant and update it if necessary.

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<plan>
Provide a multi step plan that will guide you to accomplish the goal. There
should always be steps to verify if the previous action had an effect. The plan
can be revisited at each steps. Specifically, if there was something unexpected.
The plan should be cautious and favor exploring befor submitting.
</plan>

<step>Integer specifying the step of current action
</step>

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<plan>
1. fill form (failed)
    * type first name
    * type last name
2. Try to activate the form
    * click on tab 2
3. fill form again
    * type first name
    * type last name
4. verify and submit
    * verify form is filled
    * submit if filled, if not, replan
</plan>

<step>2</step>

<think>
From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022",
using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a
dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "a324" and look at the
response from the page.
</think>

<action>
click('a324')
</action>
Note:
* Make sure to use bid to identify elements when using commands.
* If you are provided with augmented action, you may use it if needed. These actions are more task-specific and may help you achieve your goal faster.
* If you need to select an option, you may use select_option() to do this if you know the options values. Otherwise, click on the dropdown to view the options and then use select_option() to select the option.
